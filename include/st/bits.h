/**

 *
 * @brief Bits and bitfields.
 *
 * This header file provides macros for operating with bits and bitfields.
 * Use the StBits data type for bitwise operations as it avoids many issues
 * related to integral promotion, which is a common source of bugs when doing
 * bit manipulations.
 *
 * @note Compiling with -Wconversion is recommended.
 *
 * Usage.
 *   1. Set.
 * @code
 *     word |= ST_BIT(pos);
 *     word |= ST_BITMASK(hi, lo);
 * @endcode
 *
 *   2. Clear.
 * @code
 *     word &= ~ST_BIT(pos);
 *     word $= ~ST_BITMASK(hi, lo);
 * @endcode
