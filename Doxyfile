# Doxyfile 1.9.8

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").
#
# Note:
#
# Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file:
# doxygen -x [configFile]
# Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file without replacing the environment variables or CMake type
# replacement variables:
# doxygen -x_noenv [configFile]

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Cantil"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 1.0.0

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Scalable publish-subscribe implementation."

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = docs

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is
# used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found
# as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text
# and the result, after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated
# text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the
# following values are used ($name is automatically replaced with the name of
# the entity):The $name class, The $name widget, The $name file, is, provides,
# specifies, contains, represents, a, an and the.

ABBREVIATE_BRIEF       = "The $name class" \

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.
# Minimum value: 1, maximum value: 16, default value: 4.

TAB_SIZE               = 8

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For
# instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list of all
# members will be omitted, etc.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES

# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = README.md \
                         include/cn \

			 include/cn/os \
			 include/cantil \
			 include/cantil/logger \
			 include/cantil/os \
			 include/vx

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by doxygen.
#
# Note the list of default checked file patterns might differ from the list of
# default file extension mappings.
#
# If left blank the following patterns are tested:*.c, *.cc, *.cxx, *.cxxm,
# *.cpp, *.cppm, *.c++, *.c++m, *.java, *.ii, *.ixx, *.ipp, *.i++, *.inl, *.idl,
# *.ddl, *.odl, *.h, *.hh, *.hxx, *.hpp, *.h++, *.ixx, *.l, *.cs, *.d, *.php,
# *.php4, *.php5, *.phtml, *.inc, *.m, *.markdown, *.md, *.mm, *.dox (to be
# provided as doxygen C comment), *.py, *.pyw, *.f90, *.f95, *.f03, *.f08,
# *.f18, *.f, *.for, *.vhd, *.vhdl, *.ucf, *.qsf and *.ice.

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.md *.h

# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain example code fragments that are included (see the \include
# command).

EXAMPLE_PATH           = samples

# If the value of the EXAMPLE_PATH tag contains directories, you can use the
# EXAMPLE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left blank all
# files are included.

EXAMPLE_PATTERNS       = *.md *.h

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page
# (index.html). This can be useful if you have a project on for instance GitHub
# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the doxygen output.

USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE = README.md

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the alphabetical class index
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The IGNORE_PREFIX tag can be used to specify a prefix (or a list of prefixes)
# that should be ignored while generating the index headers. The IGNORE_PREFIX
# tag works for classes, function and member names. The entity will be placed in
# the alphabetical list under the first letter of the entity name that remains
# after removing the prefix.
# This tag requires that the tag ALPHABETICAL_INDEX is set to YES.

IGNORE_PREFIX          = Cn cn_ CN_ vx_ VX_

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the man page output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_MAN tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate man pages for
# classes and files.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_MAN           = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the XML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate an XML file that
# captures the structure of the code including all documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_XML           = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the DOCBOOK output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_DOCBOOK tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate Docbook files
# that can be used to generate PDF.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_DOCBOOK       = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to Sqlite3 output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_SQLITE3 tag is set to YES doxygen will generate a Sqlite3
# database with symbols found by doxygen stored in tables.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_SQLITE3       = YES
